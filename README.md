# pagination-frontend
## A demonstration of pagination on the frontend
To run this project, install the node dependencies and run "npm start" from a terminal in the frontend folder of the parent folder.
This project uses react-bootstrap and bootstrap itself.
Data is fetched from jsonplaceholder API, so to see the data (comments) for the first time, an Internet connection is needed.
Pagination is done on the frontend, so all comments are loaded once on page load then pagination controls determine which comments are displayed.
